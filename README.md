# 📘 Leetcode-Daily-Grind (Leetcode Problem of the Day (POTD))

🚀 This repository contains my daily solutions to the **Leetcode Problem of the Day (POTD)**.  
Each solution is written with clarity, optimized approaches, and includes **time and space complexity analysis**.  

My goal is to maintain consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and track my growth in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 🛠️ Problem Approach

For each problem:
1. **Understand the problem statement**  
2. **Work out brute force approach**  
3. **Refactor to optimized approach (Greedy, DP, etc.)**  
4. **Analyze Time & Space Complexity**  
5. **Write clean and well-commented code**

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Solve **every Leetcode POTD**  
- ✅ Improve **coding speed & accuracy**  
- ✅ Build a **public knowledge base** of well-documented solutions  
- ✅ Track **consistency and long streaks**  

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker

- ✅ Consistently solving **POTD** on Leetcode.  
- 📈 Building a long-term **daily streak**.  
- 🔍 Exploring multiple approaches (Brute Force → Optimized → Space Efficient).
